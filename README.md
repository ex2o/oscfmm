Order Selection with Confidence for Finite Mixture Models

### Details

The script [Simulation.R](scripts/Simulation.R) implements the simulations. The script [Descriptives.R](scripts/Descriptives.R) loads and combines the simulation results, transforms them from a nested list to a simpler (`data.frame`) format, then produces some basic descriptives and tables of interest.
